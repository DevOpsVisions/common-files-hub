# How to Contribute

## Types of Contributions

Understanding the types of contributions available is key to effectively participating in our community.

This guide provides all the information you need to contribute effectively to our community.

### Opening Issues

One primary way to contribute is by opening issues on GitHub. Issues help identify areas for improvement, report bugs, or raise questions.

**Examples of issues include:**

- **Reporting new bugs**: If you discover a bug, report it by submitting a detailed issue.
- **Suggesting new features**: Propose new features by creating an issue.
- **Proposing improvements or enhancements**: Suggest improvements or enhancements to existing features by submitting them as issues.
- **Asking questions**: Raise questions on specific topics not previously covered. (Always check Closed Issues first.)

### Reacting to Issues

- **Reacting to issues**: Show your support or interest in specific issues by reacting to them. This helps collaborators and moderators understand community interest and prioritize issues.

### Implementing and Developing Issues

- **Reviewing board items (stories)**: Review issues or stories on the project board and contribute code to implement them.
- **Reviewing board items (bugs)**: Review reported issues and bugs on the project board and provide fixes.

### Fixing Bugs or Typos With No Issues

Correcting bugs or typos in the repository helps maintain its professionalism and reflects the quality of the content offered.

If you find a bug or typo, simply fork the repository, make the corrections, and create a pull request (PR). Remember to follow our [Contribution Culture](contribution-culture.md) guidelines.

### When to Open an Issue and When to Open a Pull Request

A good rule of thumb is to open an issue when proposing any changes to the information contained within the repository. Open a pull request when you have a concrete change or fix to contribute.
