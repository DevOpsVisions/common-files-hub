# How to Contribute

## Types of Contributions

Understanding the types of contributions available is key to effectively participating in our community.

This guide provides all the information you need to contribute effectively to our community.

### Opening Issues

One primary way to contribute is by opening issues on GitHub. Issues help identify areas for improvement, report bugs, or raise questions.

Examples of issues include:
- Suggestions for improvements.
- Reporting bugs or problems.
- Asking questions on specific topics not previously covered. (Always check Closed Issues first.)

### Reacting to Issues

Reacting to issues is a valuable contribution because it helps collaborators and moderators gauge interest in a specific topic or identify recurring problems/questions among multiple users.

### Fixing Bugs or Typos

Correcting bugs or typos in the repository helps maintain its professionalism and reflects the quality of the content offered.

If you find a bug or typo, simply fork the repository, make the corrections, and create a pull request (PR). Remember to follow our [Contribution Culture](contribution-culture.md) guidelines.

## How to Contribute on GitHub

### Guidelines for GitHub Contributions

GitHub thrives on being open source, and this repository is no different. You can find the list of issues in our repository and select the one you would like to work on.

### When to Open an Issue and When to Open a Pull Request

A good rule of thumb is to open an issue when proposing any changes to the information contained within the repository. Open a pull request when you have a concrete change or fix to contribute.
