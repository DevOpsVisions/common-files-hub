# Contribution Culture

## Culture and Guides for Contributors

### For All Contributors (Not Moderators)

1. Try to make small changes first.
2. Verify your changes before pushing them to the repository.
3. Update often and right before pushing to avoid merge conflicts.
4. Ensure your pull request has only changes (commits) related to the relevant issue
5. To ensure your pull request has only the relevant commits.
6. Check the size of the issue first; if it is large, divide it into smaller items if possible.
7. Don't move the item from "New" to "Ready" until it has a size and priority.
8. Use comments in issue to discuss any topics related to that issue.
9. Pay close attention to commit messages, as they will explain why a change was made. Consider commit messages as a mini form of documentation for the change.
10. Be a team player and follow agreed-upon conventions and workflows, regardless of your background or preferences.

### Convention for GitHub Titles

To distinguish between issues and pull requests (PRs) in GitHub while following best practices, we use specific conventions for titles:

**Convention for GitHub Issue Title:**

Format: `[Type] - [Component/Area] - [Brief Description of Problem or Need]`

Example: `Bug - User Authentication - Error When Logging In`

- **[Type]**: Indicate the type of issue, such as Bug, Feature Request, Improvement, Task, Documentation, or Refactor.
- **[Component/Area]**: Mention the specific component, feature, or area of the project affected (e.g., User Authentication, UI, API).
- **[Brief Description of Problem or Need]**: Provide a short and clear description of the problem, need, or request.

**Convention for Pull Request (PR) Title:**

Format: `[Action] - [Component/Area] - [Brief Description of Change] (Issue ID)`

Example: `Refactor - User Authentication - Simplify Login Logic (#456)`

- **[Action]**: Specify the action being taken, such as Add, Fix, Refactor, Update, Remove, Enhance, or Document.
- **[Component/Area]**: Mention the specific component, feature, or area of the project affected (e.g., User Authentication, UI, API).
- **[Brief Description of Change]**: Provide a concise description of the change or improvement.
- **(Issue ID)**: Include the relevant issue ID in parentheses to link the PR to the corresponding issue.

**Examples:**

- **Issue Title**: `Feature Request - Dashboard - Add User Analytics Section`
- **PR Title**: `Add - Dashboard - User Analytics Section (#123)`

By distinguishing between the purpose of an issue (describing a problem or request) and a pull request (indicating a specific action taken to address an issue), the titles become more informative and aligned with best practices for collaborative development.

### For Moderators

1. **Do not merge a pull request (PR) that is not related and linked to any issues.**
2. Review all PRs to ensure they are related to the appropriate issues.
3. Verify that PRs contain only commits that correspond to the designated issue.
4. Monitor the size and scope of issues, encouraging contributors to split larger items into smaller, manageable tasks.
5. Ensure items are not moved from "New" to "Ready" until they have a size and priority.
6. Oversee discussions in issues to ensure clarity and constructive collaboration, and redirect contributors from chat to comments for all non-urgent communications.
7. Enforce proper naming conventions for PR titles and commit messages.
8. Maintain a collaborative and inclusive environment, promoting adherence to the workflow and culture guidelines.
