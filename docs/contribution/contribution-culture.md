# Contribution Culture

## Culture and Guides for Contributors

### For All Contributors (Not Moderators)

1. Try to make small changes first.
2. Verify your changes before pushing them to the repository.
3. Update often and right before pushing to avoid merge conflicts.
4. Ensure your pull request has only changes (commits) related to the relevant issue
5. Check the size of the issue first; if it is large, divide it into smaller items if possible.
6. Don't move the item from "New" to "Ready" until it has a size and priority.
7. Use comments in issue to discuss any topics related to that issue.
8. Pay close attention to commit messages, as they will explain why a change was made. 
9. Consider commit messages as a mini form of documentation for the change.
10. Be a team player and follow agreed-upon conventions and workflows, regardless of your background or preferences.


### Convention for GitHub Issues and PRs

Our Issues and Pull Requests (PRs) adhere to specific conventions and standards. Please ensure that you follow these guidelines.

### For Moderators

1. Review all PRs to ensure they are related to the appropriate issues.
2. Do not merge a pull request (PR) that is not related and linked to any issues.
3. Verify that PRs contain only commits that correspond to the designated issue.
4. Monitor the size and scope of issues, encouraging contributors to split larger items into smaller, manageable tasks.
5. Ensure items are not moved from "New" to "Ready" until they have a size and priority.
6. Oversee discussions in issues to ensure clarity and constructive collaboration, and redirect contributors from chat to comments for all non-urgent communications.
7. Enforce proper naming conventions for issues and PRs titles and commit messages.
8. Maintain a collaborative and inclusive environment, promoting adherence to the workflow and culture guidelines.
