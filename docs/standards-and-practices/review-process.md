# Pull Request (PR) Review Process

## 1. Preparation Phase
- **Assign Reviewers**: When creating a PR, assign appropriate reviewers who have the expertise relevant to the changes.
- **Provide Context**: Include a clear description of the changes in the PR, along with any relevant issue numbers, screenshots, or context that will help reviewers understand the purpose and impact of the changes.
- **Add Labels**: Use labels to categorize the PR (e.g., `bugfix`, `enhancement`, `documentation`) and indicate its status (e.g., `WIP - Work In Progress`, `Ready for Review`).

## 2. Review Checklist
### For Reviewers:
- **Timely Feedback**: Please provide your review and feedback within 2-3 days of being assigned the PR. Timely reviews help keep the development process moving smoothly and avoid delays.
- **Content Completeness**: Check if the content is complete, with all relevant files, tests, and documentation updated.
- **Content Quality**: Ensure the content adheres to our content standards, is well-organized, and follows best practices for readability, maintainability, and efficiency.

- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide feedback that is clear, constructive, and respectful. Focus on the code, not the author.

### For Authors:
- **Respond to Feedback**: Address reviewer comments promptly. Make necessary changes and update the PR with additional commits or amend existing ones.
- **Clarify if Needed**: If a comment or feedback is unclear, ask for clarification to ensure the PR meets the reviewers' expectations.

## 3. Approval Process
- **Approval Threshold**: A PR should receive at least the minimum of two approvals before merging.
- **Resolve Conflicts**: Ensure that there are no merge conflicts. Rebase or merge the latest changes from the target branch if necessary.
- **Final Check**: Perform a final check to ensure all tests pass, there are no unresolved comments, and the PR is fully approved.

## 4. Merging the PR
- **Squash and Merge**: Squash commits into a single commit to keep the main branch history clean and easy to follow.
- **Post-Merge Actions**:
  - Delete the source branch if it is no longer needed.
  - Update relevant documentation, release notes, or changelogs as needed.
  - Notify relevant stakeholders about the merge, especially if it impacts other teams or systems.

## 5. Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Loop**: Regularly review and refine the PR review process to improve efficiency, quality, and collaboration.
- **Awareness**: Provide awareness sessions and resources to help team members understand and follow the PR review process effectively.

## Best Practices
- **Timely Reviews**: Review PRs promptly to avoid blocking progress. Aim to review within 2-3 days of assignment.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide feedback that is clear, constructive, and respectful. Focus on the code, not the author.
- **Collaborative Reviews**: Encourage collaboration and discussions during the review process to improve the overall quality of the code and foster a team-oriented approach.
