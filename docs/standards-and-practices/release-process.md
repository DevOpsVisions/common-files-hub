# GitHub Release Process

## 1. Preparation Phase
- **Review Open Issues/PRs**: Ensure all issues and pull requests (PRs) that are targeted for the release are merged and closed.
- **Update Documentation**: Verify that all documentation (e.g., README, CHANGELOG, API docs) is up-to-date and reflects the new changes.
- **Version Numbering**: Decide on the version number for the release using semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v2.0.0`).

## 2. Pre-Release Checks
- **Run Tests**: Ensure all automated tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) pass successfully.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Perform code quality checks, including linting, code formatting, and security scans.
- **Staging Environment**: Deploy the code to a staging environment to perform final validation and smoke testing.

## 3. Create the Release
- **Tag the Release**:
  - Go to our GitHub repository.
  - Navigate to the **Releases** section.
  - Click on **Draft a new release**.
  - Choose a tag version (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and select the target branch (usually `main` or `master`).
- **Add Release Title and Description**:
  - Title the release with the version number (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
  - Include a detailed description of changes, new features, bug fixes, and any known issues. Refer to our CHANGELOG for this information.
- **Attach Binaries or Assets (if applicable)**: If our project produces binaries or other assets, upload them as part of the release.

## 4. Post-Release Actions
- **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform our team and stakeholders about the new release via our preferred communication channels (e.g., email, MS Teams, or other tools).
- **Deploy to Production**: If applicable, deploy the release to the production environment following our deployment procedures.
- **Monitor**: After deployment, monitor the release for any issues using error tracking and monitoring tools. Address any critical issues immediately.

## 5. Documentation and Feedback
- **Update Project Documentation**: Update any project documentation to reflect the new release, including any version-specific information.
- **Gather Feedback**: Solicit feedback from users and stakeholders to identify any issues or improvements for future releases.

## 6. Continuous Improvement
- **Retrospective**: Conduct a post-release retrospective to discuss what went well, what didnâ€™t, and how the process can be improved.
- **Implement Improvements**: Apply lessons learned to enhance the release process for the next iteration.

## Best Practices
- **Automate Where Possible**: Use CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure Pipeline) to automate testing, building, and deployment steps.
- **Maintain a CHANGELOG**: Keep a detailed changelog to document changes across versions.
- **Use Semantic Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning to communicate the nature of changes clearly.
- **Backup and Rollback Plan**: Have a backup and rollback plan in case something goes wrong after the release.
